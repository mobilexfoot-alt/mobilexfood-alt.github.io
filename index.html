<h2>Present Simple</h2>
<p><b>Explanation:</b><br>
Present Simple is used to talk about things that are always true or happen regularly. We use it for daily routines, habits, repeated actions, permanent situations, facts, and general truths.

Present Simple is also used in fixed programs such as train times, school schedules, and TV programs. We often use time expressions like <i>always, usually, often, sometimes, every day, every week, never</i>. Do not use Present Simple for temporary actions happening at the moment of speaking.</p>
